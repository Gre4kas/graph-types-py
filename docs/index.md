# Graph Library Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for **graph-types-py**, a custom graph library implementation focused on SOLID principles and clear architectural boundaries.

## Core Concepts

*   **[Graph Types](graph_types.md)** ([Укр](graph_types_ua.md)): Explore the 4 fundamental graph types (`SimpleGraph`, `Multigraph`, `Pseudograph`, `Hypergraph`) and their specific use cases.
*   **[Installation](installation.md)**: How to install and set up the library.
*   **[Quickstart](quickstart.md)**: Get up and running in minutes.
*   **[Visualization](VISUALIZATION.md)**: How to visualize your graphs.

## Integrations

*   **NetworkX**: Seamlessly convert graphs to/from NetworkX using `NetworkXAdapter`.
